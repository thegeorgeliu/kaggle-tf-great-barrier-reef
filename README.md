TensorFlow - Help Protect the Great Barrier Reef
================================================

Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-great-barrier-reef

Goal of the Competition
-----------------------
The goal of this competition is to accurately identify starfish in real-time by building an object detection model trained on underwater videos of coral reefs.

Your work will help researchers identify species that are threatening Australia's Great Barrier Reef and take well-informed action to protect the reef for future generations.

Project Organization
--------------------

The workspace structure is still tentative and will be updated as the project progresses.

Organization is based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/">cookiecutter data science project template</a>.
